# SMALR

This repository provides the annotation tool and the fitting code that fits the [SMAL](http://smal.is.tue.mpg.de/) model to a set of images with annotated 2D keypoints and silhouettes and performs refinement as described in the SMALR [paper]((http://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/zuffiCVPR2018.pdf)): _Lions and Tigers and Bears: Capturing Non-Rigid, 3D, Articulated Shape from Images_, by Silvia Zuffi, Angjoo Kanazawa, and Michael J. Black, CVPR 2018.

If you are looking for the 3D results from the SMALR paper, please find them in the [project page](http://smalr.is.tue.mpg.de/).

This was also used for making the training data for [SMALST](https://github.com/silviazuffi/smalst).

We provide a demo for applying the code to images of the Tasmanian tiger, the Grevy's zebra, and cheetah.

The code was written by Silvia Zuffi and Angjoo Kanazawa, with contributions from Matt Loper, Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Gerard Pons Moll.

## Installation
The code requires python 3.8 and the following packages:
chumpy,
opencv,
matplotlib,
numpy,
opendr,
mesh library (https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh),
SMPL (https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/),
Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download)

You can follow this procedure:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv_smalr_online
$ source venv_smalr_online/bin/activate
$ pip3 install chumpy
$ pip3 install opencv-python
$ pip3 install matplotlib
$ pip3 install opendr
$ pip3 install sklearn
```
You need to do the following changes to opendr:
- In `venv_smalr_online/lib/python3.8/site-packages/opendr/common.py` change line 467 adding cast to int as `(int(verts_by_face.shape[0]/f.shape[1])`.
- In `venv_smalr_online/lib/python3.8/site-packages/opendr/renderer.py` search for `dImage_wrt_2dVerts` and add a cast to int as `int(self.v.r.size/3)`.
- In `venv_smalr_online/lib/python3.8/site-packages/opendr/camera.py` at line 102 add the cast to int as `int(self.v.r.size*2/3)`.

Install the mesh library following the instructions in https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh.

Download Eigen, you do not need to compile it.

You need to compile the code in the directory `src/smalr/sbody/alignment/mesh_distance`.
To do this go to the directory:
```bash
$ cd src/smalr/sbody/alignment/mesh_distance
```
Edit the file `setup.py` to set `EIGEN_DIR` to the location of Eigen. Then type:
```bash
$ make
```

Place the directory `smpl_webuser` from SMPL in the `src/smalr` directory. Note that to use python3 you need to load the pickle file with:
```python
dd = pickle.load(open(fname_or_dict, "rb"), encoding='latin1')
```
Settings are listed in `smalr_settings.py`.

## Running the Demo
Run
`python run_on_animals.py`.

You will obtain images like the ones below:

![demo](./images/frame7584_v_opt.png)
![demo](./images/frame7181_v_opt.png)
![demo](./images/frame0000_v_opt.png)
![demo](./images/frame0002_v_opt.png)


In the settings file, there is an option `max_tex_weight` that if set to True gives sharp texture, and if set to False gives smooth texture.
We used smooth texture for the Tasmanian tiger in the [SMALR](http://smalr.is.tue.mpg.de/) paper and shape texture for making the dataset of Grevy's zebra in the
[SMALST](https://github.com/silviazuffi/smalst) paper.

We also provide a couple of examples with cheetahs, using only one image.

## Annotation Tool
This repo also contains the annotation tool in Matlab we used to annotate the keypoints in [`src/annotate_kp_matlab`](./src/annotate_kp_matlab). The driver is `annotate_images.m`. Please look at the [README](./src/annotate_kp_matlab/README.md) file in the annotation tool directory for more details.
